 *
 *   new Registry([new StripeGatewayFactory($http)], [
 *       'card' => ['factory' => 'stripe', 'options' => [...]],
 *   ]);
 *
 * omnisense/contracts' Registry: each gateway's calls go through its usage
 * policy (the provider's policy.json), which a gateway's "policy" tightens
 * (never looser) and its "usage" checks (what the site is: commercial,
 * open_source, contract) - both beside "options" or in them. policy(),
 * policies() and guard() give them; guarded() gives the gateway behind its
 * guard, each request refused before it is sent once a limit is reached
 * (UsageLimitReachedException), while get() gives it as before, unguarded.
 * Either way the waits a provider asks for (a 429's Retry-After, a RateLimit
 * field with nothing left) hold its calls. Every gateway counts in the
 * limiter given as the third argument (in memory by default): an
 * application served by many processes gives a shared one, so that a wait
 * holds in all of them.
