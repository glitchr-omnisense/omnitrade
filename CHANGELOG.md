# Changelog

## Unreleased (1.x)

### Added
- `Http\Redaction`: what the providers call at their catch of the HTTP client's exception, so
  that a `ProviderException` carries none of the request's secrets - its message with the key's
  parameters, the URL's user part and the request's secrets masked as `***` (`text()`), as
  previous a copy of the client's exception, the same class and code (`copy()`), and no trace
  of the chain keeping its arguments (`withoutArguments()`).
